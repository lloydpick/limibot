LimiBot - 0.6.5 Beta Public Release
===================================

Installation
============

  1) Load the sql dump into a database of your choice, I highly recommend phpMyAdmin (http://www.phpmyadmin.net) for this stage
  2) Browse to the 'settings' table, and edit...
     
       ServerIP - The IP of the IRC Server you wish to connect to
       ServerPort - The Port of the IRC Server
       ServerPass - The Password (if any) of the IRC Server
       ServerNick - The Nickname of your bot
       ServerNickSecondary - The Secondary Nickname of your bot, incase the first is in use
       NickIdentify - RAW IRC Command to Authenticate your Bot with IRC Server Services (if any)
       ShowRaw - '1' to show the RAW IRC Commands in the console, '0' to hide them

  3) Open the 'limibot.php' file in a text editor...

       $IRC_mySQL_Info_Server - The location of your mySQL database
       $IRC_mySQL_Info_User - The mySQL Username
       $IRC_mySQL_Info_Pass - The mySQL Password
       $IRC_mySQL_Info_DataB - The mySQL Database name
       
  4) Thats it your done! All other configuration is done by editing the various mySQL tables.
  
  
Upgrading
=========

  If you are upgrading from a previous version open up the upgrade065.php file in a text editor and edit
  the SQL variables. Then run the update065.php file from the command line...
  
  "php upgrade065.php"
  
  This will update your SQL tables to 0.6.5 of limibot.

  You MUST do this if you want to update, MUST!

Starting the Bot
================

  *nix - "screen -S limibot"
         "php limibot.php"

  win32 - "php limibot.php"


Unfortuantly there is no more documentation for this release, expect more in the next version.
If you encounter any bugs (which you probably will) please post on the bug tracker on the sourceforge page...
