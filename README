LimiBot - 0.6.4 Beta Public Release
===================================

Installation
============

  1) Load the sql dump into a database of your choice, I highly recommend phpMyAdmin (http://www.phpmyadmin.net) for this stage
  2) Browse to the 'settings' table, and edit...
     
       ServerIP - The IP of the IRC Server you wish to connect to
       ServerPort - The Port of the IRC Server
       ServerPass - The Password (if any) of the IRC Server
       ServerNick - The Nickname of your bot
       NickIdentify - RAW IRC Command to Authenticate your Bot with IRC Server Services
       BotStart - This is filled by the bot automatically
       ShowRaw - '1' to show the RAW IRC Commands in the console, '0' to hide them
       PID - This is filled by the bot automatically
       Version - Shows the version of LimiBot you have

  3) Open the 'limibot.php' file in a text editor...

       $IRC_mySQL_Info_Server - The location of your mySQL database
       $IRC_mySQL_Info_User - The mySQL Username
       $IRC_mySQL_Info_Pass - The mySQL Password
       $IRC_mySQL_Info_DataB - The mySQL Database name
       
  4) Thats it your done! All other configuration is done by editing the various mySQL tables.
  
  
Upgrading
=========

If you are upgrading from a previous version just overwrite all the files and run the following SQL command...

INSERT INTO `settings` VALUES ('Version', '0.6.4 Beta (Public Release)', 'LimiBot Version Number');

This is the only change to the databases in this update, the full list of changes can be found in the changelog.txt file.


Starting the Bot
================

  *nix - "screen -S limibot"
         "php -q limibot.php"

  win32 - "php -q limibot.php"


Unfortuantly there is no more documentation for this release, expect more in the next version.
If you encounter any bugs (which you probably will) please post on the bug tracker on the sourceforge page...
